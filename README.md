GRCh37/HG19 Genomic Coordinate Generator:
=========================================

This is a simple script to generate GRCh37/hg19 genomic coordinate for OMIM genes.

You will need genomic.gff which can downloaded from NCBI:

- [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genomes/?taxon=9606](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genomes/?taxon=9606)

You will need to select the GRCh37.p13 dataset, download the 'Annotated features (GFF3)' and extract the genomic.gff file from the downloaded ZIP archive.

And mim2gene.txt which can be downloaded from OMIM:
